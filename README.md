# Fuck Ops

FUCK OPS (as it is today). Life is too short to use shitty tools.

The tools I hope to build are:
* *Typed:* The goal is upholding typesafety when it matters most.
* *API First:* Forget bullshit tools that expect you to use their CLI only, or
  worse still, UI-driven with API being on the back burner. Fuck that.
* *Bootstrappable:* This restates 'Infrastructure as Code' idea basically. No
  brainer. Current Ops thinking demonstrated via the tooling today shows it
  doesn't believe in this at all. Not in reality. Annoying as fuck.
* *Testable:* It's amazing how many Ops tools are not really testable at all
  without manual actions involved. Life is too short.
* *Well Defined:* Use well defined (and simple) APIs and protocols to make
  this happen.
